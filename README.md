An online community where people with different expertise can connect to share their knowledge. The project will be a hub where people can look up specific interests or share their passions and expertise.
Our application will consist of two user groups; tutors and learners. The tutors will post their qualifications and proficient areas using a profile system. They will also indicate if they will tutor remotely or in person. The tutors can also choose to share their knowledge in various media formats such as video tutorials, online documentation, etc. The learners will be able to search for their desired topic and/or browse through a variety of other topics as well as qualified tutors on those respective topics.
